# ✅ Viva Questions – EDA (Titanic Dataset)

### 1. What is EDA and why is it important?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It helps:
- Understand the structure of data
- Detect outliers, missing values, and anomalies
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Prepare for modeling by selecting features and transforming data appropriately

### 2. Which plots do you use to check correlation?

To check correlation between variables, we typically use:
- **Heatmaps** (e.g., `sns.heatmap()`): Show correlation coefficients between numeric features.
- **Pairplots** (e.g., `sns.pairplot()`): Show scatterplots between all variable pairs with distributions.

### 3. How do you handle skewed data?

Skewed data can be handled using:
- **Logarithmic transformation**: `np.log1p(x)`
- **Box-Cox transformation**: Using `scipy.stats.boxcox`
- **Square root or cube root transformation**
- **Winsorization**: Capping extreme values
- For skewed categorical distributions, grouping rare categories may help.

### 4. How to detect multicollinearity?

Multicollinearity can be detected using:
- **Correlation matrix**: High correlation (> 0.8) between independent variables may indicate multicollinearity.
- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: VIF > 5 (or 10) suggests multicollinearity.

```python
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor

vif = pd.DataFrame()
vif["VIF"] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
vif["Feature"] = X.columns
